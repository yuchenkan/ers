# Background

This is here because the requirement of the build system of this project is too _fancy_. I've written the Makefile serveral times and I can't realize what I want. Make is somewhat broken when facing complicated situation. To name a few, it handles file name matching in two different ways, it's not only inconsistent but also contains the gap between these two ways, meaning it can't handle every situation. It also can't handle the deleted file very well.

This is a replacement of Make for incremental build in a parallel way. It's designed to be simple and flexible. It's implemented in JavaScript and JavaScript is powerful in making the implementation very concise.
